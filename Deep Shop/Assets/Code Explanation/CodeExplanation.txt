#1 My first implementation was using a single variable to store the state, because at one moment I can only have one segment running. Doing one test where I had saved the Q_1 quest with only one segment, I saw that if I have modified the Quest via its Scriptable Object adding one more Craft Segment I can not track if the quest has been modified. With an array I can check if the quest saved in the file has the same number of segments than the Scriptable Object, plus I can check the state of previous and next segments.
